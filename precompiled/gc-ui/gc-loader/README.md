# gc-loader
gc-loader is an SVG animation component to convey a sense of 'loading' to the viewer.  It takes four opts

### Opts
* width - self explanatory
* height - self explanatory
* speed - how quick it appears to move 
* type - bar or circle depending on type of symbol wanted

### Example
```
<gc-loader height="172" width="164" speed=".9" type="bar"></gc-loader>

```

### TODO
* Investigate console errors thrown by chrome
* Consider changing to CSS animations rather than SVG
